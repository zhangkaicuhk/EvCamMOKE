# EvCamMOKE

This is a public repository of DVS event camera data sets. 

The data in "SlowExpansion" and "Feedback" is used to generate results of our publication "Event-based Vision in Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect Microscopy", which describes details of the experiments.

The data in "ExtraData" is extra data, taken with optimized parameters.

# Raw Data Format

The raw data is stored as CSV files. The events are expressed as "x, y, polarity, timestamp".
